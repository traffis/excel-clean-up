# excel-clean-up
This is a Python script I created when I was working for my university's IT department.
This script cross-references tickets from one of the system's and an Excel sheet, and updates
the Excel sheet.

The website used for this script is removed. The code in the files are how I obtained
the elements from the site and the logic of operations performed.

There was a monthly and tedious task that the students needed to do monthly, and I created
this script to automate the tedious portion of it. It could use some more work, especially
the way to obtain username and password information. I wasn't able to get that to work via
console when I first created this, and I no longer work there.
